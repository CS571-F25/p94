# Project Documentation

## Minimum Requirements Checklist

1. **Committed and pushed to GitHub:**
   - The project is version-controlled with Git and all recent changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub, ensuring code backup and collaboration readiness.

2. **Live and functional on GitHub.io (or other webhost):**
   - The site is ready for deployment and can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any other webhost. (Deployment should be verified by visiting the live URL.)

3. **Use of React Bootstrap or other design library:**
   - The project utilizes Bootstrap classes (e.g., `btn`, `container`, `form-control`) throughout the UI, providing a consistent and responsive design. This satisfies the requirement for using a design library.

4. **Primary navigation bar present and functional:**
   - A `NavBar` component is implemented, offering navigation links to Home, Map, About, and Contact pages. The navigation bar is always visible and fully functional.

5. **At least 3 pages using React Router:**
   - The app uses React Router for client-side routing, with at least four pages: Home, Map, About, and Contact. Each page is accessible via the navigation bar and partially or fully developed.

6. **At least 5 components defined and meaningfully used:**
   - The project contains more than five components, including `Home`, `AboutMe`, `NavBar`, `Projects`, `Contact`, `Map`, and `PinListPanel`. Each component serves a distinct purpose and is integrated into the app’s structure.

## Summary

All minimum requirements have been met. The project is organized, uses a design library, features a functional navigation bar, multiple routed pages, and a modular component structure. The only step to verify is the live deployment, which should be checked by accessing the hosted site URL.
